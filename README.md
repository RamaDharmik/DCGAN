# DCGAN
Made a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network for Generation of Human Faces

# MNIST DCGAN

This project implements a **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)** trained on the MNIST dataset to generate realistic handwritten digits.  

The goal of this repository is to provide a **beginner-friendly, modular, and well-documented implementation** of GANs using PyTorch. By exploring this project, you will learn how GANs work, how to structure training loops, and how to visualize progress with TensorBoard.
